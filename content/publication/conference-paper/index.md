title: Kinodynamic Rapidly-exploring Random Forest for Rearrangement-Based
  Nonprehensile Manipulation
abstract: Rearrangement-based nonprehensile manipulation still remains as a
  challenging problem due to the high-dimensional problem space and the complex
  physical uncertainties it entails. We formulate this class of problems as a
  coupled problem of local rearrangement and global action optimization by
  incorporating free-space transit motions between constrained rearranging
  actions. We propose a forest-based kinodynamic planning framework to
  concurrently search in multiple problem regions, so as to enable global
  exploration of the most task-relevant subspaces, while facilitating effective
  switches between local rearranging actions. By interleaving dynamic horizon
  planning and action execution, our framework can adaptively handle real-world
  uncertainties. With extensive experiments, we show that our framework
  significantly improves the planning efficiency and manipulation effectiveness
  while being robust against various uncertainties.

summary: Our approach combines local rearrangement and global action
  optimization for nonprehensile manipulation, with free-space transit motions
  between constrained rearranging actions. We use a kinodynamic planning
  framework to search in multiple regions, allowing for global exploration of
  relevant subspaces and effective switches between local actions. The framework
  can adapt to real-world uncertainties and improves efficiency and
  effectiveness while remaining robust against uncertainties, as shown by
  extensive experiments.
